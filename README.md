This repository is used to record my JavaScript projects.

1. [Guessing Number](https://rongyangariel.github.io/JavaScript_Projects/number-guessing-game-start.html) is a number guessing game based on Javascript and HTML.

2. [Pig Game](https://rongyangariel.github.io/JavaScript_Projects/Pig%20Game/index.html), a classic dice game, implemented by JavaScript.
  GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach winning score points on GLOBAL score wins the game
